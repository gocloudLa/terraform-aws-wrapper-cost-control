title: "Complete Example"
description: "This example demonstrates a comprehensive Terraform configuration for cost control using a module named 'wrapper_cost_control'. It includes setting up various budgets and cost anomaly detection."
main_purpose: "The main purpose is to manage and control cloud costs using predefined budgets and anomaly detection."
key_features:
  - "**Monthly Cost Budget**: A budget with a monthly limit of 2100, time unit set to MONTHLY, and thresholds at 105 and 120."
  - "**Daily Cost Budget**: A budget with a daily limit of 70, time unit set to DAILY, and a threshold at 120."
  - "**Dynamic Monthly Budget**: A budget with automatic adjustment every 6 months, notification type set to ACTUAL, and a threshold at 110."
  - "**Cost Anomaly Detection**: Enabled with an absolute threshold of 10 and a percentage threshold of 20."
